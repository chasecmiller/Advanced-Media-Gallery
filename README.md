# Advanced-Media-Gallery
Conceptual plugin for Wordpress to provide an advanced media library.

Using Amazon's Rekognition for automatic label to post_tags, facial rekognition and more.

Automatic labelling is working correctly.

Working out some logistic issues with facial rekognition.

Although the plugin is free, AWS has a very small cost.

Always looking for contributors.
